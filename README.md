# Research Projects on Canadian Regional Climate Models

## Models Used

### Canadian Regional Climate Model, [CanRCM4](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/science-research-data/modeling-projections-analysis/centre-modelling-analysis/models/regional-model.html).

### Canadian Large Ensembles Adjusted Dataset v1, [CanLEADv1](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a97edbc1-7fda-4ebc-b135-691505d9a595).

## Statistical Modeling

### Hierarchical Bayesian model written in [STAN](https://mc-stan.org/) based on [Tebaldi et. al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-985X.2008.00545.x).

### Novel ensemble pooling approach with Copula models used for bivariate models and uncertainty quantification through Bayesian parameter estimation.
